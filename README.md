# bootstrap_portfolio
A portfolio page made with Bootstrap 4
This weeks challenge was to build a portfolio site with bootstrap 4. 
I created the github repository then cloned it to my computer and created a folder structure. I added the images to the images folder. I added the bootstrap codes to the html file and codes from google fonts, to be able to use different fonts for my webpage.
This portfolio page has:
-A navbar which is responsive, with links that navigate to the approppriate sections of the page.
-A jumbotron with an image and some information and welcome to my site.
-A work section displaying my work in grid, using bootstrap cards for each project.
-Each card has a picture, a description and a link, leading to that webpage.
-Each card has a fun hover effect and a little bit of box shadow.
-Each button on the cards become darker while hovering.
-A skills section, which is an unordered list, listing my skills and the skills that I would like to learn during the bootcamp.
-An about section with a short introduction and a photo of me.
-The skills and the about section is in one row using bootstrap 4 grid layout.
-A footer with an e-mail link addressed to my e-mail address.

I used bootstrap 4 classes to make the website responsive to different screen sizes.
